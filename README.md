# credit-risk-prediction
Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Course with the United Network of Professionals (UNP). 
Key highlights:
Studied and Analysed the Credit Risk Prediction dataset to apply Machine Learning Models and presented my insights.
Performed Datacleaing also performed various Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset to understand the data and compared the variables.
Experimented with different Machine Learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier, Ridge Logistic Regression, K-Means Clusterings Classifier, XG Boost Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier.
Compared the results to recommend the best Classification Model.
